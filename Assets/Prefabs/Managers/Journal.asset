    <Body>k__BackingField: 'The SEEKERS OF SENSE hereby request a building permit
      for developments on an owned plot in the north quarter of Radefell. Using this
      land, we plan to construct a place of worship where all members of our organization
      may gather in peace and prayer.

      

      We are also seeking a loan
      of 50,000 biscila from the Treasury of the Bank of Radefell. We will mainly
      use these funds to purchase stone and lumber.

      

      It is about
      time a church was established in Its name.

      a week ago and have grown stronger since. Getting down here alone was enough
      of a struggle, but if anything that may mean that our intuition was right and
      I\u2019m getting closer to the source! *A line crosses out:* Disturbing lack
      of any source of life around the crypts, no bugs, no bats, not even plant life.
      Another quake just happened and I swear I heard a faint deep, slow croak, almost
      like a deathrattle\u2026 something else is down here with me. \r\n"

    <Body>k__BackingField: "\u201CTo our dear healers, your persistence in your work
      in the face of adversity is admirable. I am sure the Malignance grants you
      their favor as you work in their name. However, I understand some of you have
      approached others with questions regarding the nobility of your acts. Nursing
      is one of the most difficult jobs to take up in the church, and seeing the
      conditions these people are in and sometimes even seeing them pass is difficult
      to stomach. Know that they have passed for a reason, everything happens for
      a reason under The Perfect One. I do ask, though, if you do ever find yourself
      questioning your own actions, or the work of the Malignance, do keep it to
      yourself. Have you seen the fool in town clamoring against us? The last thing
      you\u2019d want to be is just like them.\u201D\r\n"

      shall fall and the just shall be granted entrance into Paradise. We granted
