      in the face of adversity is admirable. I am sure the Malignance grants you
      their favor as you work in their name. However, I understand some of you have
      approached others with questions regarding the nobility of your acts. Nursing
      is one of the most difficult jobs to take up in the church, and seeing the
      conditions these people are in and sometimes even seeing them pass is difficult
      to stomach. Know that they have passed for a reason, everything happens for
      a reason under The Perfect One. I do ask, though, if you do ever find yourself
      questioning your own actions, or the work of the Malignance, do keep it to
      yourself. Have you seen the fool in town clamoring against us? The last thing
      you\u2019d want to be is just like them.\u201D\r\n"
