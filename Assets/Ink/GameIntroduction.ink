Everything is coated in darkness. 

It reeks of death

Your mind flashes… 

You hear screams… 

Flickers of blood…

Sight, hearing, touch, taste, scent…restored but not recovered 

You blink into consciousness, yet the world around you does not

The memories fade, but the smell of death still lingers

Your soul hangs inbetween, familiar but foreign 

But, everything happens for a reason 

Right?
