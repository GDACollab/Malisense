Captain said we lost a crew, and put us on the job to find them. What they didn’t tell us was the state of Radefell. It was… horrible… I was the only one who left those forsaken crypts with my life. I was able to get away from one of those… dog monsters, but I was being followed by some oversized bug. I didn’t think I’d have to use it but I threw some of the dynamite we found off of the deceased crew. After a bright flash I expected the thing to be blown to smithereens, but it stood there. Thankfully it writhed in pain at the sheer sound of the blast so I was able to escape. I sprinted out of there, scared the sound and light would have brought more to me if I stayed.
