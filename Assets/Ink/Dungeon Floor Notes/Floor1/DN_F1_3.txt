On the Crypt-Quakes:
The quakes started a little under a week ago and have grown stronger since. Getting down here alone was enough of a struggle, but if anything that may mean that our intuition was right and I’m getting closer to the source! <s> Disturbing lack of any source of life around the crypts, no bugs, no bats, not even plant life. Another quake just happened and I swear I heard a faint deep, slow croak, almost like a deathrattle… something else is down here with me. </s>
