<b><size=+10>Whispering Bell Development Log 13</size></b>

Our continued development of the Bell has been going well. It has been noted that upon ringing it, the subject felt an echo rippling out as though it was an extension of their own senses. This gave the user heightened hearing through the Malignace’s blessings, granting an ability similar to echolocation in nature; albeit only limited to the Malignace’s vestige. Progress in gifting the Malignance the senses it awaits has gained great traction. We Seekers of Sense shall further explore this ability in preparation for the Festival.
