Crawling through these abandoned and infested ruins, I was prepared to observe these frightening creatures, but I did not expect to be watched myself. I’ve had a creeping feeling of dread following me ever since I stepped foot in here, but no matter what I do, I can’t ever spot my observers… It’s almost as though they-

-Stumbled onto so many of them. A nest? But-
Oh no. Oh Father, I’ve made a grave mistake. 
They see me. 
I should’ve known the moment I was close enough to see them back, it would be my end.
