<b><size=+10>Apparition Gauntlet Development Log 27</size></b>

As we place more souls within the gauntlet, we seem to have awoken an entirely new ability. Previously, the gauntlet was only used to hold souls for the Malignance. As we continue to put souls within it, a spectral hand has manifested. The hand only appears a few feet away from the wielder and the wielder can somewhat control it. The hand seems to be weak and can only interact with a few things. We wonder if the addition of more souls would strengthen this ability or further develop it. We Seekers of Sense must further investigate this discovery as the Festival gets closer.
