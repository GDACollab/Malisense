Just my luck, I ran into an eye creature down here. Luckily I escaped, but not by means that I expected. Earlier into my delving I collected some glowing dust scattered about the crypts, it would at least not reflect any of my lanternâ€™s light. However, when I encountered the eye beast I knew I had to run away, but I came to a dead end, cornered against the beast. With some quick thinking I shined the lantern toward it, and tossed some of the dust into my lantern, causing a blinding light for both myself and the creature. I presume that due to its strength in sight it was much more affected by the light than I, and I was able to escape from the now blinded monster. The smell of the smoke was unbearable though, and the resulting sound echoed through the halls, so I had to seek shelter to hide away from anything else I could have attracted.
