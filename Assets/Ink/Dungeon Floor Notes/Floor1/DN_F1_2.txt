The SEEKERS OF SENSE hereby request a building permit for developments on an owned plot in the north quarter of Radefell. Using this land, we plan to construct a place of worship where all members of our organization may gather in peace and prayer.

We are also seeking a loan of 50,000 biscila from the Treasury of the Bank of Radefell. We will mainly use these funds to purchase stone and lumber.

It is about time a church was established in Its name.
