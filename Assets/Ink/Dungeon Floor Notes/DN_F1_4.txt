“To our dear healers, your persistence in your work in the face of adversity is admirable. I am sure the Malignance grants you their favor as you work in their name. However, I understand some of you have approached others with questions regarding the nobility of your acts. Nursing is one of the most difficult jobs to take up in the church, and seeing the conditions these people are in and sometimes even seeing them pass is difficult to stomach. Know that they have passed for a reason, everything happens for a reason under The Perfect One. I do ask, though, if you do ever find yourself questioning your own actions, or the work of the Malignance, do keep it to yourself. Have you seen the fool in town clamoring against us? The last thing you’d want to be is just like them.”
