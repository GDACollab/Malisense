“Hey Custi, I really needed to talk to you today but you didn’t answer your door so I’ll just leave this. I really need to get that watch back. I know that the first rule of gambling is ‘Never bet something that you’d regret if you lost,’ but I didn’t understand the value of it at the time. You see, the wife and I are trying to get out of this town and she’s been really down in the dumps about abandoning her hometown, kind of like she’s losing a part of her. That item was an heirloom from her family. I only bet the thing because it was collecting dust in our attic, I didn’t know she cared so much about it. So please, if there’s anything I could do to get it back I can repay back tenfold, just let me know.”
