The screams grow deafening, I can feel the bitter taste upon my tongue fading, but I must commit this to page. Iâ€™m taking the Eye to the town in the city outskirts. I do not comprehend the power of these artifacts, but if it can be a tool in reversing this malignance, I will keep it within reach.

With contrition,
Meitar Poppet
