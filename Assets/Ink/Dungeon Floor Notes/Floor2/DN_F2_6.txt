I write this now, for I dare not speak such troublesome things to my fellow Clergymen. But, I simply can not shake the growing dread I feel, so I hope writing my worries down shall alleviate them slightly. 
The day before last, I felt an ominous chill during prayer; a horrid shiver down my spine, as if it had been pierced by an icy blade. In spite of the teachings, I opened my eyes. For just an instant I opened them. And…

I’m sure I must be mad but…

I could’ve sworn the Eye… blinked. I know I sound mad, but I swear, that’s the only way I could describe it.
Ever since, I’ve felt a distressing fear that someone or something may be watching me. Or, I suppose, will be watching me the moment I close my eyes. I have never felt anything like this, and I am really quite scared. I don’t know what to do. I haven’t been able to sleep.
