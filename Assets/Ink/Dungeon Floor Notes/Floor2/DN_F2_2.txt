“Father, I do not see how I can go on. I know I shouldn’t be thinking about things of this nature, but it has become hard to even sleep at night. Who I see in the mirror now is not who I saw years ago, very rarely do I even smile anymore. What may remedy this father? I joined the church in search of a sense of family, but I’ve never felt more isolated. I am lost in a blindingly dark forest, I just cannot find a way out."
