Brothers and Sisters of Radefell, march with your Church to celebrate the emergence of The Great One. The arrival bears closer, so we must all prepare to satisfy our beloved god. 

Dawn your cloaks and take up the gifts of incense. May it sheathe the scent of your sins, and march proudly with it. Hold them up high and may the lines of smoke rise up for all to see. Take pride in your faith as we near a new age. Extend your arms and embrace The Great One.
