<b><size=+10>The Eye of Genesis Development Log 34</size></b>

The further development of the Eye of Genesis brought out a most curious result as we continue to explore the amuletâ€™s power of foresight. We discovered those wielding the Eye felt that the artifact seemed almost alive, as if it was watching them. This artifact is starting to show some risk but we still want to further investigate this phenomenon, despite the dangers. The goal is paramount. As a precaution, we separated the necklace and the pendant. Regrettably, this artifact may be a potential failure regarding our original goal, an attempt to give the Malignance a form in Time and Space. But as we continue to work on it, we may need to find a way to destroy it too. However, with the Festival being right around the corner, we Seekers of Sense must finish working on this artifact swiftly.
