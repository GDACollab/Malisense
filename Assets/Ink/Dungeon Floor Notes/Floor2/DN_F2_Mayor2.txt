The edges of this erstwhile page are torn and browned with age.
The Church kept my position under strict check, but I knew they were laboring toward an ineffable achievement: giving form to their god, if such a monstrosity deserves the honorific. They showed me one of their instruments, an enigmatic eye. No words could belay the sensation, the keening at the edge of my vision, as I beheld the Eye then. I knew as its sight stared back at me, the Church would bring no genesis, but our doom.

And I curse the rest of my days for standing by, allowing this fate befall on the public who trusted me to lead them.
