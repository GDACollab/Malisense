To Father,

	I know your work with the church is important. But I never see you around these days all I get from Mother is your artifacts will save us and other high praises from her. She and I are very proud but I just want you to come home once in a while. Have dinner with us or something, we miss you.

May ▇▇▇▇ bless you,
Your son …
