To …..
	Forgive the haste in my penmanship, but premonition of what comes at this eve’s festivities has stricken me with a feverish anxiety. I cannot speak to the true source of this malaise, only that the Church will manifest it. We… I sat in complicity with the Church’s true actions, but there will be no time to lament such sin in remaining within the city. If there is any word of mine left to trust, it is this: flee Radefell with whatever you and your family can grasp. If you treasure your mind and your sense, heed these last words of mine.

	There is one final course I will seek to take before retreating to the outskirts. If we do not meet there, it is my deepest hope that it is for your swiftness, and not your discountance.

Godspeed old friend,
 Mayor Meitar Poppet
