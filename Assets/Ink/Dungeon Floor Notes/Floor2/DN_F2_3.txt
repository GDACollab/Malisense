“Democritium, my workshopped name, is the gemstone that occupies our crypts, seemingly having some kind of magical properties. This was brought to my attention on my last trip down into the crypts, purely by accident actually. There was a shard of the red gemstone on the ground, which I put into my bag, and I eventually came into contact with, what I theorize to be, the gemstone which the shard came from. When I touched it to my bag, with no exaggeration, it disappeared off of my body for a second and reappeared next to the gemstone. This may require some more tests on just what can and cannot be teleported, but this could be life changing, no, humanity changing.”
