The hour of salvation is nigh, brethren! Sorrow not, for soon ye shalt bask in Its warm embrace. For it is It who hath come to rescue us from this wretched, wicked world! Gather your lovers, your children, your neighbors. ‘Tis now when righteousness prevails–when the sinners shall fall and the just shall be granted entrance into Paradise. We granted It a piece of ourselves, and in turn It shall grant us life Eternal.
