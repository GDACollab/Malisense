      any of my lantern\u2019s light. However, when I encountered the eye beast I
      knew I had to run away, but I came to a dead end, cornered against the beast.
      With some quick thinking I shined the lantern toward it, and tossed some of
      the dust into my lantern, causing a blinding light for both myself and the
      creature. I presume that due to its strength in sight it was much more affected
      by the light than I, and I was able to escape from the now blinded monster.
      The smell of the smoke was unbearable though, and the resulting sound echoed
      through the halls, so I had to seek shelter to hide away from anything else

      new ability. Previously, the gauntlet was only used to hold souls for the Malignance.
      As we continue to put souls within it, a spectral hand has manifested. The
      hand only appears a few feet away from the wielder and the wielder can somewhat
      control it. The hand seems to be weak and can only interact with a few things.

    <Body>k__BackingField: "The edges of this erstwhile page are torn and browned
      with age.\r\nThe Church kept my position under strict check, but I knew they
      were laboring toward an ineffable achievement: giving form to their god, if
      such a monstrosity deserves the honorific. They showed me one of their instruments,
      an enigmatic eye. No words could belay the sensation, the keening at the edge
      of my vision, as I beheld the Eye then. I knew as its sight stared back at
      me, the Church would bring no genesis, but our doom.\r\n\r\nAnd I curse the
      rest of my days for standing by, allowing this fate befall on the public who
      trusted me to lead them. \r\n"

    <Body>k__BackingField: "The screams grow deafening, I can feel the bitter taste
      upon my tongue fading, but I must commit this to page. I\u2019m taking the
      Eye to the town in the city outskirts. I do not comprehend the power of these
      artifacts, but if it can be a tool in reversing this Malignance, I will keep
      it within reach.\r\n\r\nWith contrition,\r\nMeitar Poppet\r\n"
